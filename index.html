        <h2><u>Unit: " EM"</u></h2>
        <p>
            The em and ex units depend on the font type and may be different for each element in the document. The em is simply the font size. In an element with a 2in font, 1em  means 2in. Expressing sizes, such as margins and paddings, in em means they are related to the font size, and if the user has a big font e.g on a big screen or a small font e.g. on a mobile device the sizes will be in proportion. text-indent: "1.5em" and margin: "1em" are common in CSS.

        <h2><u>Font Family : "Pacifico" , "cartoonist_handregular"</u></h2>
        <p>
           The reason why i  have choosen this to Fonts is because the background is lightpink so it conveys a light mood and the font color is black so the font is also readable. H1 tag which is the title Web typography has the font family "Pacifico" which is Cursive and the reason why i choose this webfont is because it makes the title tag look elegent and also makes it stand out so people know that it is the tile and that why this font family is perfect for all the H1 tags and title tags. and for all the H2 and P tags i have choosen "cartoonist_handregular" which is simple and easy for any kind of user to read and it is also understandable.
